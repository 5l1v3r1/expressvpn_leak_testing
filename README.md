# ExpressVPN Leak Testing Tools

This repository contains tools built by ExpressVPN for testing the how leak-proof our applications
are. The test suite is currently a work in progress and should be considered in **alpha** state.

## Tools to appear soon

We will be open sourcing our tools in the near future. In the meantime, if you have any questions
regarding the tool set please feel free to contact us and we'll try to provide you with help or
other information.
